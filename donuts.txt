I just love donuts!  Donuts are the best.  Donuts are the staple food of police officers.  

The best donut is a chocolate donut.  You have to get the ratio of icing to cake just right.  There needs to be lots of chocolate icing.

The worst thing that can happen to a donut is for the icing to stick to the paper bag.  This ruins the donut and renders it inedible.

The worst kind of donut is a Krispy Kreme.  It is virtually all sugar glaze with no cake element to it.  And very overpriced for what it is.
