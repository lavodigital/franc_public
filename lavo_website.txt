Long duration energy storage (LDES) solutions are essential in solving the energy storage problem and reaching net-zero targets. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar are not always reliable, and existing technologies can only store energy for a few hours. LDES solutions provide dispatchable and reliable renewable energy when it's needed, not just when it's generated.

Lavo's patent-pending metal hydride technology, combined with a fuel cell and electrolyser, creates the integrated Hydrogen Energy Storage System (HESS), providing groundbreaking long duration storage. Green hydrogen LDES solutions, like Lavo's, will play a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of green hydrogen as an energy source.

Augmented intelligence is used in Lavo's digital platform, Lavo FRANC, to respond to customer demands for accessible, safe, and scalable green fuel storage solutions. The platform enables customers to optimize the operation of LDES products by providing consistent, real-time information for effective and efficient energy generation, storage, and dispatch management.

Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and is found naturally on Earth in water and other organic compounds. It can be used as a fuel source to power engines, generate heat, or be converted into electricity through fuel cell technology. Unlike other fuels, hydrogen emits no carbon dioxide when burned.

Green hydrogen is essential for achieving a net-zero future. It is a critical enabler of the energy transition, with predictions that a significant portion of the world's future energy needs will be met by green hydrogen. Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis, using renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen.

Lavo uses its patented metal hydride technology for LDES. This technology allows for the safe storage of hydrogen at low pressure, providing a reliable and safer alternative to high compression or liquified storage. Lavo's LDES solutions have distinctive benefits, including safe storage, affordability, scalability, long duration, and sustainability.

Existing battery technology alone is insufficient for long-duration storage, making LDES solutions critical in reaching net-zero targets. Lavo's green hydrogen LDES solution complements the adoption of green hydrogen as an energy source. It unlocks the potential of renewables and brings efficiency to energy management through an intelligent digital platform.

Lavo's innovative product suite combines LDES with an intelligent digital platform, offering a full-service solution with short-long term storage capabilities.
